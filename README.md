# Improving Single-View Mesh Reconstruction for Unseen Categories via Primitive-Based Representation and Mesh Augmentation

PyTorch implementaton of our IROS2022 paper "Improving Single-View Mesh Reconstruction for Unseen Categories via Primitive-Based Representation and Mesh Augmentation".  
You can visit our project website.

In this paper, we propose a primitive-based deformation framework to reconstruct view-centered meshes from RGB images, in which it better generalizes to the object categories that are unseen during training. Moreover, we propose a novel strategy for 3D mesh augmentation to enrich and diversify the training data.
